# Better iOS Projects: Advanced Usages of rbenv

![](assets/Ruby_1_cut.jpg)
*Digging deeper with ruby*

In the series "Better iOS Projects", we have a look at the various tools and environments that are useful to have a more convenient and efficient handling of iOS Projects.

## Special Note
You should not have to use root user permissions via _sudo_ for any of the calls that follow. If you seem to need to, you most likely already had a permission problem before or you did not install and setup _rbenv_ correctly.

## Advanced Usages of rbenv

After we learnt to install and use _rbenv_ and _bundler_ in the previous post of the series "Better iOS Projects", [How to manage the ruby environment of your iOS Project using rbenv](https://number42.de/blog/2018/05/22/rbenv-2018-05-22-rbenv.html), we continue by having a look at some of the more advanced features and pitfalls of using _rbenv_ and _bundler_.

### How do I use bundler in _ruby_-scripts?

To ensure that the correct versions of gems are used inside a ruby script, you need to require _rubygems_ and _bundler/setup_ at the top of the script:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/ruby

# Non-Bundler Dependencies
require 'optparse'
require 'ostruct'

# Support for Bundler and Gems
require 'rubygems'
require 'bundler/setup'

# Now, the version of xcodeproj defined via Bundler is used
require 'xcodeproj'
```

### Using binstubs

To ensure that all calls use the version defined in the _Gemfile_ without prefixing the call with `bundle exec`, you can append `--binstubs` along with the gems to stub to the installation command:

```bash
bundle install --binstubs fastlane
```

It is recommended to explicitly name the gems you want to stub to avoid conflicts with gems that deliver their own stubs, e.g. _rake_.

Then, you can call the command by prepending `bin/`, e.g.

```bash
bin/fastlane
```

You can also add `export PATH="./bin:$PATH"` to your shell's rc file (see above) to always search the bin folder (where binstubs are installed to) when running commands. This might have [security implications](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/wiki/Understanding-binstubs) though. I you do this, it is enough to type

```bash
fastlane
```

As an alternative to binstubs, you can also add the alias `alias be="bundle exec"` to your .rc file, to make the original call shorter:

```bash
be fastlane
```

## Bonus: How to automate installing the correct ruby version and gems

At Number42, we always include a script called [bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/num42/n42-buildscripts/blob/master/bootstrap.sh) in our projects, which does the most basic setup calls needed to run the project afterwards. Whenever something does not work out of the box after cloning (or pulling) a project, calling `sh bootstrap.sh` is able to sort out the larger part of problems in most cases. We use this the same way for iOS and web projects. We will have a closer look at the bootstrap script in an upcoming episode of this series.

Among those are the installation of _ruby_, _Bundler_ and _Gems_:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# exit script on error
set -e

# define colors
RED=`tput setaf 1`
GREEN=`tput setaf 2`
NOCOLOR=`tput sgr0`

# Guard to update brew only once and only if necessary
NEEDS_TO_UPDATE_BREW=1

# Helper to install brew dependencies
installDependencyWithBrew(){
  if [ $NEEDS_TO_UPDATE_BREW -eq 1 ]; then
    echo ""
    echo  "${GREEN} UPDATING BREW ${NOCOLOR}";

    # update brew to keep dependencies up to date
    brew update || echo "${RED} FAILED TO UPDATE BREW ${NOCOLOR}";
    NEEDS_TO_UPDATE_BREW=0
  fi

  echo ""
  echo  "${GREEN} INSTALLING $1 WITH BREW ${NOCOLOR}";

  # install dependency, if is not installed
  brew list $1 || brew install $1 || echo "${RED} FAILED TO INSTALL $1 ${NOCOLOR}";

  # upgrade dependency, if it is outdated
  brew outdated $1 || brew upgrade $1 || echo "${RED} FAILED TO UPGRADE $1 ${NOCOLOR}";
}

# Install ruby if a .ruby-version exists
if [ -e ".ruby-version" ]; then
  echo ""
  echo  "${GREEN} SETTING UP RUBY ${NOCOLOR}";

  installDependencyWithBrew rbenv
  installDependencyWithBrew ruby-build
  # install ruby version from .ruby-version, skipping if already installed (-s)
  rbenv install -s
fi

# Install gems if a Gemfile exists
if [ -e "Gemfile" ]; then
  echo ""
  echo  "${GREEN} INSTALLING GEMS ${NOCOLOR}";

  # install bundler gem for ruby dependency management
  gem install bundler --no-document || echo "${RED} FAILED TO INSTALL BUNDLER ${NOCOLOR}";
  bundle install || echo "${RED} FAILED TO INSTALL BUNDLE ${NOCOLOR}";
fi
```
