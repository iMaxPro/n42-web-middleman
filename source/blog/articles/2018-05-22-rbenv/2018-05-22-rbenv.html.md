# Better iOS projects: How to manage the ruby environment of your iOS project using rbenv

![](assets/Ruby_cut.jpg)
*Managing rubies is easier with rbenv.*

In the series "Better iOS projects", we have a look at the various tools and environments that are useful to have a more convenient and efficient handling of iOS Projects.

## Special Note
You should not have to use root user permissions via _sudo_ for any of the installs that follow. If you seem to need to, you most likely already had a permission problem before or you did not install and setup _rbenv_ correctly.

## How to manage the ruby environment of your iOS Project using rbenv

### Why do we want to do this?
_ruby_ has been used to program and run a variety of iOS development tools, such as [_fastlane_][1], [_cocoapods_][2] or [_xcodeproj_][3].

macOS comes with an older version of _ruby_ preinstalled by default.
As the system uses _ruby_ itself, it is best practice not to mess around with the system ruby and use a user-installed (and more up-to-date) version of the ruby language.
A ruby version manager allows you to maintain multiple installs of different ruby versions at the same time and decide per project (automatically via the _.ruby-version_ file) which version of ruby you want to use.

A glossary of tools and filenames used in this article is available at the end of this article.

## Which ruby environment manager should I use?

We have a smooth experience using [rbenv][4], but you should be able to get similar results using [rvm][5] or [chruby][6].

## Install and setup rbenv
### install brew
_rbenv_ can easily be installed using the [brew][7] package manager, so make sure you have it installed and running.

### install rbenv and ruby-build using brew
Install _rbenv_ (for managing _ruby_ environments) by running

```bash
brew install rbenv
```

this will also install _ruby-build_ tool (for installing versions of _ruby_ via _rbenv_)

If you are upgrading run

```bash
brew upgrade rbenv ruby-build
```

### setup rbenv for your shell

After installing the tools above, you need to add a call to setup _rbenv_ to your shell's configuration script.

You can find out which shell you are using by calling

```bash
echo $0
```

Depending on the result, you need to either change _\~/.bash\_profile_ (for bash), _\~/.zshrc_ (for zsh) or the corresponding file of your shell if you have another shell.

If the file (e.g. _\~/.bash\_profile_) does not exist before, just create it.

As we use the very good [Oh-My-ZSH][8] as shell, we can edit it by opening _\~/.zshrc_ in a graphical text editor or edit it directly in the shell by calling

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Add

```bash
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```

to the end of the file and save it, then quit your terminal application and reopen it to make sure the changes are applied.


## rbenv commands
rbenv has various commands, which should be listed when you run

```bash
rbenv help
```

The most important for us in the scope of this article are:

### rbenv version

This shows the current ruby version set via _rbenv_. By default, this should show _system_. It also shows you the path to the file that is responsible for selecting the version.

### rbenv versions

This lists all versions of ruby installed via rbenv (and the system version).

### rbenv install <Version>

Installs a specific version of ruby.
You can look up the newest version of ruby at [ruby-lang.org][9].

Also, `rbenv install -l` shows you a list of versions available to _ruby-build_. If you are missing a version, upgrade _ruby-build_ by running `brew upgrade rbenv ruby-build`.

### rbenv local

This shows or sets the version defined for the current directory and its subdirectories.

### rbenv rehash

This can become handy if you have trouble using a gem after having it installed, as it updates the underpinnings of rbenv.

### Debugging

_rbenv which_ and _rbenv whence_ are useful if you have issues when using ruby via _rbenv_ and something does not work as expected.

## Install a custom ruby and create the .ruby-version file

Start by installing the newest version, which is 2.5.1 at the time of this post:

```bash
rbenv install 2.5.1
```

See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ for the most recent version.

If there already is a _.ruby-version_ file, run

```bash
rbenv install
```

without any version argument to install the version set in the _.ruby-version_ file.

Enter your iOS project directory and run

```bash
rbenv local 2.5.1
```

to create a _.ruby-version_ file with the content `2.5.1`.

_rbenv local_ will only do this, if the version is already installed.

After restarting the terminal (or entering the parent directory and reentering the directory), running `rbenv version` should give you the version  `2.5.1` if everything worked correctly.

## How to use Bundler
### What is Bundler?

_bundler_ is a dependency manager for _ruby_, as _cocoapods_ is for the iOS ecosystem.
It can ensure that a defined set of dependencies is installed with the exact version of dependencies (gems) that was used when the dependencies where updated the last time.

### How to install bundler

For every ruby version installed via rbenv, you have to once run

```bash
gem install bundler
```

to install the dependency manager.

### What files does Bundler use?

Bundler defines dependencies using a _Gemfile_.

This defines, what _gems_ (and possibly: what versions) you __want__ to have installed:

```bash
# List of gems used in this project
gem "cocoapods", "~> 1.5"
```

When updating gems (or adding them to the project), the exact version of the gem that __will__ be installed is written to a file named _Gemfile.lock_.

### Adding and updating gems

When you do not have a _Gemfile_ yet, you can create one by running

```bash
bundle init
```

To add a first dependency, you can run `bundle add <Gemname>`, e.g.

```bash
bundle add fastlane
```

This adds the dependency to the Gemfile and installs the new dependency.

Running

```bash
bundle install
```

resolves the dependency graph in the _Gemfile_, installs the dependencies and writes the resolved versions to the _Gemfile.lock_ file. This is important if you edit the _Gemfile_ by hand.

You should now be able to run

```bash
bundle exec fastlane
```

if everything went right.

To sync the dependencies across the developers of the project, it is important to commit both _Gemfile_ and _Gemfile.lock_ to your project.

### When do I need to run bundle install and bundle update?

Generally, you only need to run `bundle update` if you really intend to upgrade the versions of your gems.
When you check out a project and want to get it to build, it is sufficient to run `bundle install` most of the time.

## Where to go from here?

Install and properly manage the gems your project needs and at least teach your team how to install new ruby versions via _rbenv_ and gems via _bundle_.

In the next post of the "iOS Projects done right" series, we will have a look at some advanced features of rbenv. Stay tuned!
