# Better iOS projects: How to manage your tooling with mint
![](assets/Mint.png)

In the series "Better iOS projects", we have a look at the various tools and environments that are useful to have a more convenient and efficient handling of iOS projects.

## How to manage your tooling with mint

Since the (still recent, in comparison to other languages) release of the Swift programming language, a lot of tooling has been added to support developing in it.

We got _SwiftLint_ to lint our code, _SwiftFormat_ to apply format and coding guidelines, _SwiftGen_ to get rid of all the string-dependent API calls and _Sourcery_ to generate huge amounts of code we would have to tediously write by hand otherwise.

But all this tooling is third-party and because of this, we need to manage it by ourselves.

Some of the approaches on how to install these tools are:

-   download a binary
-   install it via _CocoaPods_
-   install it via _Homebrew_

There are some downsides to these approaches:

-   The method of installation might not be supported: Not all dependencies are available as a binary AND via _CocoaPods_ AND via _Homebrew_, so you end up with a mix of systems.
-   You depend on the update being published to the manager you use, which can take some time.
-   You cannot specify the exact version to use.
-   You might need to clutter your repository with large binary blobs.

## What do we need from a Tool-Version Manager?

You want to have the **exact same version** of the tool for you, your team members and your CI Server. This way, all the tools behave the same way across your development team and everybody gets the same warnings and generates the same code, thus avoiding differences in behavior.

You do not want to have to be forced to update your tooling on the day you want to give your App into review, so you need to be able to
**install a specific version** instead of having to use the most up to date version of the tool. This helps to avoid problems in the case there is a bug in the newest version of the tool you are using (happened to us with _Sourcery_).

You want to be able to install a **specific version per project**. Different projects have different needs for synchronization. Having a tool as a global dependency just does not work in some cases.

## What is the Problem with brew?

_Homebrew_ is a really great tool for providing terminal tools. Installing additional tools is a charm. But: for most tools, _Homebrew_ no longer has the option to install a specific version of the tool. As you can not go back to a previous version, the only way to keep versions synchronized across team members is to install the latest version available. This becomes absolutely infeasible for agencies with lots of projects and additional external developers. Somebody will always forget to upgrade brew. Installing your own internal tools is possible by creating your own _Homebrew_ tap, but it adds some additional overhead and maintenance.

# What does Mint do?

[Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint) is a dependency manager that internally uses Apple's Swift Package Manager (SPM) to build swift tools. If the tool is written using SPM (which is the way to go to be able to use external dependencies for CLI, see [this great post by @JohnSundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/building-a-command-line-tool-using-the-swift-package-manager)) it usually can be built using mint without a problem. So far, _SwiftLint_, _SwiftFormat_, _Marathon_, _XcodeGen_ and _Sourcery_ are some of the most relevant tools that can be installed using mint. _SwiftGen_ will be installable when the next version (v6.0) is released.

### Install mint

You can find several ways to install mint on [GitHub](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint).

One easy way is to run

```bash
brew install mint
```

### mint run

To just run a package, type

```bash
mint run <repo-name>
```

e.g.

```bash
mint run yonaskolb/xcodegen
```

This installs and runs the latest version.

To run a specific version, you can add a release tag or a branch or a git commit hash:

```bash
mint run yonaskolb/xcodegen@1.8.0
```

You can also pass git URLs like `git@github.com:yonaskolb/Mint.git` to the install command. This allows you to also install and run internal, non-public tools from their repositories.

### mint install

To install a specific version for later use, you can use `mint install`:

```bash
mint install yonaskolb/xcodegen@1.8.0
```

This installs the given version (and links it to `usr/local/bin`).

## How do I use the Mintfile?

To define the versions to use in your project, you can add a file called
_Mintfile_ to your project's root folder. In it, you can define the tools
to use along with their versions:

```
  # This is a comment
  krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery@0.13.1
  realm/SwiftLint@0.25.1
  yonaskolb/XcodeGen@1.8.0
  nicklockwood/SwiftFormat@0.33.7
```

For commands run in this folder, that do not contain a version specification, _mint_ will look up the version in the _Mintfile_.

So, running

```bash
mint run xcodegen
```

with the _Mintfile_ present will install and run version "1.8.0" instead
of a newer version. Note that you can leave out the user part (e.g. "yonaskolb/") as it is defined in the _Mintfile_ already.

### mint bootstrap

Running

```bash
mint bootstrap
```

installs the versions defined in the _Mintfile_ (without linking them), so that you are prepared to use the versions from inside your buildscripts in _Xcode_.

## Automating the installation via mint

At Number42, we always include a script called [bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/num42/n42-buildscripts/blob/master/bootstrap.sh) in our projects, which does the most basic setup calls needed to run the project afterwards. Whenever something does not work out of the box after cloning (or pulling) a project, calling sh bootstrap.sh is able to sort out the larger part of problems in most cases. We use this the same way for iOS and web projects. We will have a closer look at the bootstrap script in an upcoming episode of this series.

This is an excerpt of the script, which shows how we install _mint_ and run `mint bootstrap`:

```
#!/bin/sh

brew update

function install_current {
  echo "trying to update $1"
  # https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/osx/
  # avoids errors
  brew upgrade $1 || brew install $1 || true
  brew link $1
}

if [ -e "Mintfile" ]; then
  install_current mint
  mint bootstrap
fi
```

## What to do if something is broken

Mint installs tools to `/usr/local/lib/mint`, so you can delete files here if something goes wrong.
